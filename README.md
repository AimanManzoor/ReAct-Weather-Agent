# ReAct-Weather-Agent
A lightweight Agentic AI chatbot that uses the ReAct LLM framework to reason and interact with a weather API. Built in Python as a proof-of-concept for intelligent tool use.
🌤️ Agentic AI Weather Chatbot — Powered by ReAct LLM
This project demonstrates a simple but powerful Agentic AI chatbot that utilizes the ReAct (Reason + Act) paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs). The agent is designed to answer weather-related questions interactively by making calls to a live Weather API and reasoning over the responses.

🚀 Overview
This chatbot functions as an intelligent weather assistant that can:

Understand user prompts about current weather conditions.

Dynamically fetch live weather data using an external API.

Make decisions and respond based on reasoning steps using ReAct-style prompting.

The key innovation here is the Agentic architecture — the chatbot doesn't just return static responses; it reasons, plans, and executes API calls as needed to generate dynamic responses, simulating tool use.

🧠 ReAct LLM Agent
This project implements the ReAct (Reason + Act) model, a strategy developed for building agent-like behavior in LLMs. In this framework:

The agent reasons through what information is needed.

It acts by calling APIs or tools.

It reflects and iterates if necessary.

The chatbot relies on a ReAct-powered loop, where decisions are generated step-by-step to simulate real agent thinking.

🔍 The ReAct paradigm enables the LLM to generate both reasoning traces and action commands to interact with tools, enhancing its ability to perform multi-step tasks.
